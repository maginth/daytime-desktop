This tool helps to sync our ciscardian clock and to feel time passing while in front of a screen by automatically adapting the desktop dark/light theme and wallpaper.

Double click on linux/activate.sh (tested on mint cinamon desktop)  
or windows/activate.vbs (tested on windows 10/11)

== hour wallpapers

Each wallpaper name must be prefixed by the two digit of the hour it appears and be placed in the ./hour-wallpapers folder.

If several wallpaper are assigned to the same hour, the hour will be split equaly between each of those wallpapers (alphabetical order).
